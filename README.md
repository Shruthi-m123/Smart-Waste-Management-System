ABSTRACT :

As plastic waste continues to pose a significant environmental challenge, the need for 
efficient waste management solutions becomes increasingly urgent. This project introduces an 
automated plastic waste segregation system that uses machine learning, image processing, and 
automation for developing the recycling process. By using a Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN), the system is able to accurately classify different types of plastic based on their visual 
features. Once identified, the system sorts the plastics into the correct bins through a 
mechanical sorting mechanism controlled by an Arduino. Trained on a diverse dataset, the 
system operates in real-time, sorting plastics with high accuracy and efficiency. Designed for 
scalability and precision, this automated solution not only speeds up the sorting process but 
also reduces plastic contamination in recycling, promoting more effective recycling practices. 
Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to sustainable waste management, helping to reduce 
the environmental impact of plastic waste while supporting global recycling efforts. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVES:

This project aims to develop an automated plastic waste segregation system to classify and 
segregate the plastic waste into the following: 
 Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) ,
 High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) ,
 Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) ,
 Polypropylene (PP) ,
 Polystyrene (PS), 
By using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate classification and 
integrating machine learning with Arduino-controlled mechanical sorting, the system will 
improve the efficiency and accuracy of plastic recycling, reducing contamination and 
enhancing sustainability. 


The following are the objectives of the system: 
 Collecting the data of different plastic waste materials ,
 Developing a model to classify the plastic waste materials into the respective categories ,
 Real-time processing and classification of the materials, 
 Mechanical sorting of the waste materials.
